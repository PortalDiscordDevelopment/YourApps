# YourApps

YourApps is deprecated!

YourApps, despite being a valuable part of our portfolio, faced challenges in a highly competitive market. Its complexity and the lack of certain features, such as slash commands, were hindering its growth. Therefore, we decided to temporarily suspend services for YourApps, including hosting and support, until we could dedicate the necessary resources to make the required improvements.

We want to emphasize that this is a temporary measure.  We are committed to transparency and are open to addressing any questions or concerns you may have.
